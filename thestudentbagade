# Formula Student – Suspension & Chassis Dynamics

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This repository contains the design and analysis work performed as a **Voluntary Member** of a Formula Student team[cite: 75]. The primary objective was to engineer a suspension system that maximized cornering stability and maintained structural integrity under high-performance racing conditions.

## Key Contributions
* [cite_start]**Kinematic Optimization:** Designed a double-wishbone suspension system using **CATIA V5**, focusing on roll-centre stability and camber gain[cite: 76, 79].
* [cite_start]**Vehicle Dynamics Analysis:** Conducted studies to evaluate the relationship between chassis torsional stiffness and lap-time performance[cite: 77].
* [cite_start]**Structural Validation:** Performed FEM analysis on suspension mounting points to ensure safety factors during high-G cornering loads[cite: 78].

## Technical Stack
* [cite_start]**CAD:** CATIA V5 [cite: 79]
* [cite_start]**Simulation:** MATLAB/Simulink, ANSYS Mechanical [cite: 79]
* [cite_start]**Analysis:** Vehicle Dynamics, Finite Element Method (FEM) [cite: 94, 95]

## Results
* [cite_start]Optimized suspension geometry for improved driver handling and cornering response[cite: 77].
* [cite_start]Verified structural safety of all mounting points through static structural analysis[cite: 78, 95].
